# About Swiftinit

Swiftinit is a collection of richly-linked high-level technical articles and tutorials related to the Swift programming language. Kelvin Ma started Swiftinit in late 2021 when he and a few professional Swift developers realized that educational resources for the Swift language were often scattered across personal blogs or buried deep in Github repositories, making it hard to beginners to get started with the language.

Swiftinit (the site) is written in SwiftNIO!
