# ``/_AsyncChannel``

This module contains a vendored copy of the `AsyncChannel` type from `swift-async-algorithms`. Its native package is immature and has not yet been divided into sensibly-sized modules. This copy allows us to use `AsyncChannel` without adding a large amount of code to the server binary.

>   Warning:
>   The files in this module were copied unchanged from the `swift-async-algorithms` repository. It does not adhere to project policies, and modifying it to do so is a non-goal.
