    /// It is tempting to consider `BlockCodeFragment` as a special case of
    /// ``BlockCodeReference`` (`@Code`). But there are important differences that merit a
    /// separation of the two types.
    ///
    /// 1.  `BlockCodeFragment` is always eagarly inlined, and can produce multiple blocks when
    ///     inlined. This is because snippets can contain captions, which are treated the same
    ///     as markup in the documentation itself.
    ///
    /// 1.  `BlockCodeFragment` cannot have AST children, because its children live in the
    ///     referenced snippet file.
    ///
    /// 1.  `BlockCodeFragment`s can only reference a fixed set of snippets that are known early
    ///     on during the documentation build process. Moreover, it can only reference code that
    ///     is written in Swift.
    ///
    /// 1.  `BlockCodeFragment` can contain fractional syntax, which implies that code
    ///     highlighting must be performed ahead of time.
    ///
    /// 1.  `BlockCodeFragment` does not support diffing.
    ///
    /// A `BlockCodeFragment` by itself is just a snippet and slice name. It is supposed to be
    /// broken up into ``BlockCodeLiteral`` elements that contain the actual code via the
    /// snippet inlining process.
